# OpenPhysChem

## About

This repository contains the resources on the undergraduate Physical Chemistry course 
covering thermodynamics, electrochemistry, statistichal thermodynamics and chemical kinetics.

The idea of the website is greatly inspired and largely based on another open source
resource - the website of Prof. Eremin at Moscow State University [Part 1](https://www.chem.msu.ru/rus/teaching/eremin1/soderzh.html) 
and [Part 2](https://www.chem.msu.ru/rus/teaching/eremin/welcome.html). Unfortunately, some 
material is not reflected properly and the browsers often do a pretty poor job translating the website.
Hence I'm putting this as a stand-alone resource. 

In addition, this repository will include problems and teaching materials from other resources, including 
those generated by artificial inteligence (AI) tools. However, the AI-generated content is revised and 
curated by me to ensure the consistency of theory and problems/solutions.

Another distinctive feature of this repository is the used of Jupyter, to facilitate solving numerical
problems.
