    "## Basic definitions \n",
    "\n",
    "Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with the relationships between heat, work, temperature, and energy. It describes how energy is transferred between physical systems and how it affects matter. Here are some fundamental terms and definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System:** A specific portion of the universe that is under study. It can be as small as a gas in a container or as large as an entire planet.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Isolated System:** A system that does not exchange energy or matter with its surroundings.\n",
    "   - **Closed System:** A system that can exchange energy (heat and work) but not matter with its surroundings.\n",
    "   - **Open System:** A system that can exchange both energy and matter with its surroundings.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Surroundings (Environment):** Everything outside the system that can interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **State Functions:** Properties that depend only on the current state of the system, not on how it got there.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Examples include internal energy (U), enthalpy (H), entropy (S), and pressure (P).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Internal Energy (U):** The total energy contained within a system, which includes kinetic and potential energy at the molecular level.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Enthalpy (H):** A measure of the total energy of a thermodynamic system, including internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume.\n",
    "    It is defined as $H = U + PV$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Entropy (S):** A measure of the randomness or disorder of a system. It is a state function that increases with the number of microstates of a system.\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. **Path functions:** Functions that descrbe the change of properties of a thermodynamic system that depend in the path of going from one state to another state. The main examples are:  heat (Q) and work (W)\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Heat(Q):** A form of energy transfer due to temperature difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Work (W):** Energy transfer associated with a force acting through a distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Process:** A transformation from one state to another. Processes can be:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Isothermal:** Constant temperature.\n",
    "   - **Adiabatic (isoentropic):** No heat exchange with the surroundings.\n",
    "   - **Isobaric:** Constant pressure.\n",
    "   - **Isochoric:** Constant volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gas Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "Gas laws describe the behavior of gases in terms of temperature, pressure, and volume. Some of the fundamental gas laws are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Boyle's Law:** At constant temperature, the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume.\n",
    "    $P ~ \\frac{1}{V}$ or $PV=constant$\n",
    "   \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Charles's Law:** At constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $V ~ T$ or $\\frac{V}{T}=constant$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Gay-Lussac's Law:** At constant volume, the pressure of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $P ~ T$ or $\\frac{P}{T}=constant$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avogadro's Law:** At constant temperature and pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $V ~ n$ or $\\frac{V}{n}=constant$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ideal Gas Law:** A combination of Boyle's, Charles's, and Avogadro's laws. It describes the behavior of an ideal gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $PV=nRT$\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "   - P = Pressure\n",
    "   - V = Volume\n",
    "   - n = Number of moles\n",
    "   - R = Universal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol * K)\n",
    "   - T = Absolute temperature in Kelvin\n",
    "\n",
    "## Equations of State for Gases\n",
    "\n",
    "An equation of state is a mathematical model describing the state properties of a gas. The most commonly used equations of state for gases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ideal Gas Equation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   $PV=nRT$\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Assumes no interactions between gas molecules and that the volume occupied by the gas molecules themselves is negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Van der Waals Equation:** A more realistic equation for real gases that takes into account intermolecular\n",
    "   forces and the finite volume of gas molecules:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $(P+\\frac{a}{V_m^2} )(V_m−b) = nRT$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where:\n",
    "    - $a$ and $b$ are empirical constants specific to each gas, accounting for intermolecular attraction and finite molecular volume, respectively.\n",
    "    - $V_m = \\frac{V}{n}$ - molar volume of gas\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dieterici Equation of State:** The Dieterici equation of state accounts for intermolecular attraction and is another\n",
    "  modification of the ideal gas law, similar to the Van der Waals equation. The Dieterici equation includes an exponential term\n",
    "  that reduces the pressure compared to the ideal gas law, incorporating both repulsive and attractive forces among molecules more effectively.\n",
    "  It is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $P = \\frac{nRT}{V − nb}exp⁡(−\\frac{a}{RTV})$\n",
    "   where:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - a = Attraction parameter (accounts for intermolecular forces)\n",
    "   - b = Volume correction parameter (accounts for finite molecular volume)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Berthelot Equation of State:** The Berthelot equation of state is another modification of the ideal gas law that introduces corrections for intermolecular forces and the finite size of gas molecules. It is particularly useful at moderate pressures and temperatures close to the critical point.\n",
    "The Berthelot equation is a modification of the Van der Waals equation, where the attraction term is inversely proportional to temperature. This form provides a better approximation for gases near their critical points than the ideal gas law or simpler equations. The Berthelot equation is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $P=\\frac{nRT}{V−nb}−\\frac{n^2}{aTV^2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Virial Equation of State:** An equation that expands the ideal gas law to account for real gas behavior using a power series in terms of $\\frac{1}{V}$:\n",
    "    $PV=nRT (1 + \\frac{B_1(T)}{V} + \\frac{B_2(T)}{V^2} +⋯ )$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where $B_1(T)$, $B_2(T)$, etc. are first, second and so on virial coefficients that depend on temperature and the type of gas.\n"
